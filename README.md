## Talk Abstract

Knowingly or unknowingly you are constantly utilizing Information Retrieval (IR) in your daily lives. IR is the process through which a computer system can respond to a user's query for text-based information on a collection of documents. Web search is the application of IR techniques to the largest collection of text anywhere - the web. IR till date remains one of the most important data science research frontiers to explore. 

In this talk, I will introduce basic IR concepts: IR method in general, standard evaluation techniques, tf-idf scheme, traditional and machine learning based approaches, pointers for experimental research.
